<h3>Student</h3>


<ul>
<li>Name: Sean Fiscus</li>
<li>Section: MW 2:30</li>
<li>Email: sfiscus24@hotmail.com</li>
</ul>



<h3>Specifications</h3>


<ul>
<li>Open this file in Firefox and jEdit</li>
<li>Add your name, section, and email</li>
</ul>



<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

<blockquote><p>An architect's fee is calculated as a percentage of the cost of a building. The fee is made up as follows:</p></blockquote>


<ul>
<li>8% of the first $5,000.00 of the cost of a building.</li>
</ul>




<ul>
<li>Add 3% of the <i>remainder</i> if the remainder is greater than zero but less than or equal to $80,000.00, or 2.5% of the <i>remainder</i> if the remainder is more than $80,000.00.</li>
</ul>



<blockquote><p>Write a program that will accept the cost of a building and calculate and display the architect's fee.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Make sure you only use variables in all calculations. No hard-coded numbers are allowed in calculations. Refer to <a href="../javascriptCodingStandards.html#part5">here</a> for an example.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Program Planning Lists</h3>


<ul>
<li>In the following pre tag, write the three planning lists based on the verbs and nouns you see in the problem statement.</li>
</ul>

<pre class="blackGreen">
The List of Input Variables:

buildingCost

The List of Output Variables:

architectFee
firstBuildingCostAmount
buildingCost
costRemainder
architectTotal

The Process Checklist:

Declare all variables and constants used in program
Ask user to enter the cost of the building through a prompt
Convert every variable that will be a number into numerical form using number function
Create calculations based on building cost being less than or equal to 5000
Continue calcultions based on building cost being less than or equal to 85000
Continue calcultions based on building cost being greater than 85000 followed by an alert if conditions weren't met correctly
Display the cost of building followed by the total amount the architect will receive

</pre>

<h3>The Test Plan</h3>

<ul>
<li>In the following pre tag, write some test data. Be sure to include some small costs, such as 100 and say 6,000, as well as some large costs, such as 100,000. Also, be sure to include building costs which are close to important boundaries, such as 5,000, etc. </li>
</ul>

<pre class="blackGreen">
TEST PLAN:

Test Case 1:
    Inputs: "10000"
    
    Expected Results: For a building that costs $10000 the architect's fee will be $550.

Test Case 2:
    Inputs: "0"
    
    Expected Results: For a building that costs $0 the architect's fee will be $0.

Test Case 3:
    Inputs: "5000"
    
    Expected Results: For a building that costs $5000 the architect's fee will be $400.

Test Case 4:
    Inputs: "80000"
    
    Expected Results: For a building that costs $80000 the architect's fee will be $2650.

Test Case 5:
    Inputs: "85001"
    
    Expected Results: For a building that costs $85001 the architect's fee will be $2400.025.
    
Test Case 6:
    Inputs: "100000"
    
    Expected Results: For a building that costs $100000 the architect's fee will be $2775.

<h3>JavaScript Program</h3>

<blockquote><p>Write the JavaScript code based on everything you've done. Your code must follow the course coding standards. You should add good comments about the different parts of your solution. Be sure to test your program using a variety of different building costs, before being satisfied that your program will always produce correct output.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Sample Output:</h3>

<pre class="blackGreen">
For a building that costs $100000 the architect's fee will be $2775.
