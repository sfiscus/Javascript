<h3>Specifications</h3>


<ul>
<li>Open this file in Firefox and jEdit</li>
<li>Add your name, section, and email</li>
<li>Open the file <code>jsFile/project5Part5.js</code> in jEdit</li>
<li>Your JavaScript code must go in the <code>jsFile/project5Part5.js</code> 
file.</li>
<li>Read the following problem statement and begin by first planning  carefully
what you will do to accomplish this task.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Do nothing until you 
have made a plan</i>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

<blockquote>  

<p>Begin by examining the program already present in the Part 5 JavaScript library 
file. The program is complete, except for one of the functions, namely the one 
that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on the user's weight and height
inputs.<br /><br />

You must <b>complete the program</b> by writing that one function.  The formula
for the BMI calculation is given in a comment within the JavaScript  library file. 

&nbsp;No other changes need be made to the program (the set of functions). After
the modification, the program must successfully calculate the BMI based on whatever 
valid weight and height data is entered into the program by the user.<br /><br />
The program must continue to have no inputs other than just the weight and height
keyed in by the user (i.e. just as it already does).  &nbsp;Also, the program must
continue to work only with local variables.  There is no need to set up any global
variables for this project part, and it is worth zero (0) points if any global
variables are added to the js file.
</p>

</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Project Notes:
<ul>
<li>Add in no code to the function  without first having decided on a  plan for
what you will be doing.</li>

<li>  Proceed with writing the function using 'versions'. For example, version 
One might be to simply make sure that the flow of control is entering the function.
For example, version Two might be to make sure that the two inputs to the function
are successfully arriving into the function. And so on. Test each version to make 
sure it is accomplishing what you planned for it to accomplish, before going ahead
with the next version.  As is often the case, the &nbsp;alert() &nbsp;method will
be handy for verifying that a version is working properly.</li> 
<li>In establishing your test cases, be sure to include one in which the user will 
have a BMI of less than 25 (that one is already done for you as the sample output),
one
that will result in a BMI of 25, and one that will result in a BMI that is greater
than 25.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h3>Program Test Plan</h3>

<ul>
<li>For this Part 5, the Test Plan will be written in the JavaScript library file 
itself in comments &nbsp;[i.e. not in this HTML file.]</li>
</ul>

<br /><br />

<h3><strong>Project 5 - Part 5 Sample Output:</strong></h3>
<p>(In this example, the user entered 150 for weight and 65 for height.)</p>

<div class="output">
<pre>
The results for you are as follows:

	You entered your weight as being 150 pounds.
	You entered your height as being 65 inches.

	Your Body Mass Index "BMI" is thus: 24.96.

When evaluating BMI, body build and waist circumference may be among the factors
to also take into consideration. 
One conventional guideline is: If your BMI is over 25, consider discussing these
factors and your weight with your doctor.
